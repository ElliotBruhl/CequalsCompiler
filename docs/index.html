        <h2 id="about">About</h2>
        <p>
            The Cequals language and compiler were made by me, high school student Elliot Bruhl, as an extracurricular 
            project to learn more about how compilers and computers work at a lower level. I started by deciding to 
            write the compiler in the C programming language, so that I could understand more exactly how memory worked.
        </p>
        <p>
            The first month was used to learn C and make the project’s lexer. The next month was used to set up the data 
            structures where the AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) and variable/function declarations would be stored after the parsing phase. 
            The next two months were used for parsing math operations and function calls. The rest of the constructions, 
            conditionals, loops, etc., were parsed in the following month. Learning x86 assembly (the output language) 
            and writing the output code from the AST went quickly, only taking another month. The final month, for a total 
            of seven, was used to add some extra features and create nicer-looking documentation.

# Compiler Information

- **Language**: Written in C (version C17 - compatible with C99+)
- **Input**: C= (Cequals) language (documentation here later)
- **Output**: x86-64 Assembly (NASM syntax) for Win64

## How It Works

The compilation process is broken into three main steps:

1. **Tokenization**  
   The input file is read, and a list of tokens is created. Tokens include words, numbers, or symbols that have specific meanings in the language.

2. **Parsing**  
   The tokens are converted into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), which is a highly detailed, language-independent representation of the program. This step also detects and reports errors.

3. **Code Generation**  
   The AST is transformed into x86 assembly code and written to the output file.

## How to Use the Compiler (Win64)

1. Download the executable or compile it from the source files
2. Create a folder with the executable, an input file ex. "input.txt", and an output file ex. "output.txt"
3. Write some code in the input file
4. Run the executable using command: {executable name}.exe {input file name}.txt {output file name}.txt {optional arguments like -useLib}
5. Assemble the file using NASM: nasm -f win64 -g output.asm -o output.obj
6. Link the file (must link with the C standard library) using GCC: gcc output.obj -o output.exe -g
7. Run the output executable.

## Exit Codes (`main.c`)

- `0`  – Success
- `-1` – File read failed
- `-2` – Tokenizer failed
- `-3` – Variable symbol table creation failed
- `-4` – Function symbol table creation failed
- `-5` – Parser failed
- `-6` – Assembly generation failed

## The Tokenizer (`tokenizer.c/h`)

The tokenizer stores data in a **doubly linked list** of structs, where each node holds the following information:

- **Line number**
- **Token type**
- **Token value**
- **Previous node**
- **Next node**

### Token Types

1. **Identifiers** – Alphanumeric strings (except keywords).
2. **Numbers** – Whole numbers in the range `-(2^63)` to `(2^63) - 1`.
3. **Operators** – Almost all operators available in C.
4. **Keywords** – Special reserved words in the language.
5. **Separators** – Symbols like `;`, `()`, `{}`, and `,`.

## The Parser (`parser.c/h`)

The parser stores a **doubly linked list** of structs, where each node holds:

- **Sub-node type indicator**
- **Sub-node**
- **Previous node**
- **Next node**

### AST Node Types

Each sub-node is a struct containing the necessary details to generate code later:

- **Variable Declaration** – Holds the variable name.
- **Variable Assignment** – Holds the variable name and new value.
- **Function Declaration** – Holds the function name, argument count, argument names, and function body.
- **While Loop** – Holds the loop condition and body.
- **Conditional** – Holds the condition, `if` body, and optional `else` body.

### Math Operations

Math operations are particularly tricky due to order of operations and mixed operand types. To handle this:

1. Tokens are converted into **ValueNodes**, structs that store operand types (number, variable, or function call).
2. ValueNodes are converted into a **postfix expression**, which eliminates the need for order-of-operations parsing.
3. The postfix expression is then transformed into a **binary tree** of operators and operands.

## Variable Table (`varTable.c/h`)

- Tracks all variable names within a given scope.
- Computes the offset of each variable from the base pointer of the scope.
- Supports **variable shadowing** (name lookups start in the current scope and proceed outward).

## Function Table (`funcTable.c/h`)

- Tracks all function names and their parameters.
- Uses a **single global scope** for functions (no shadowing; duplicate function names overwrite each other).

## Code Generation

**In Progress**
